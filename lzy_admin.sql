vite-plugin-env-compatible\n``` bash\nnpm i vite-plugin-env-compatible \nyarn add vite-plugin-env-compatible\npnpm add vite-plugin-env-compatible\nni vite-plugin-env-compatible \n```\n再到 vite.config.ts 中进行插件配置\n``` ts\nimport envCompatible from \"vite-plugin-env-compatible\";\n\nexport default defineConfig(() => {\n  return {\n    envDir: path.resolve(__dirname, \"./env\"),\n    Plugins: [\n      vue(),\n      envCompatible(),\n    ],\n  }\n})\n```\n2. 在项目根目录创建.env和.env.production文件，其中分别配置有开发状态下和打包之后要上线的的接口路径。\n.env文件文件内容如下： ==这里我用到了vite的proxy代理 api，这里可以用服务器地址==\n``` \nVITE_BASE_URL=/api  \n```\n.env.production文件文件内容如下： ==这里使用的是你打包之后需要上传服务器的后台地址（自己注意结尾斜杠）==\n``` \nVITE_BASE_URL=http:47.113.222.95:8089\n```\n3. 在vue项目中使用配置路径  (不需要导入任何东西，直接使用import.meta.env来获取即可)\n``` ts\nconst api = import.meta.env.VITE_BASE_URL\nhttp(\"get\", api + \"/proxyApis/jinrishici/info\", headers).then((res: ipGetType) => {\n    //将个人信息存入localStorage，避免每次刷新都要请求接口\n    setLocalStorage(\"weatherData\", res.data)\n});\n```\n4. 这个打包的缺点就是不能在css中使用动态地址，必须通过js渲染（vue的动态style）\n\n\n## node+ts+webpack\n使用webpack的原因是，网上用vite打包node的参考比较少。webpack对比vite确实不是很便捷，暂时只能做到打包，没办法解决打包之后的路径的问题，只能手动去更换线上路径，比较麻烦，后面想办法再进行优化吧。\n以下是打包过程：\n1. 安装webpack、ts-loader、typescript\n``` bash\nnpm i webpack webpack-cli ts-loader typescript\nyarn add webpack webpack-cli ts-loader typescript\npnpm add webpack webpack-cli ts-loader typescript\nni webpack webpack-cli ts-loader typescript\n``` \n2. 然后在==webpack.config.js==进行配置，ts文件使用ts-loader进行处理。\n``` js\n// webpack.config.js\nconst path = require(\"path\");\n\nmodule.exports = {\n    entry: \"./app.ts\",\n    target: \"node\",\n    output: {\n        filename: \"bundle.js\",\n        path: path.resolve(__dirname, \"dist\"), // 输出文件夹路径\n        publicPath: \"/\" // 公共路径，用于处理静态资源的访问路径\n    },\n    resolve: {\n        extensions: [\".ts\", \".js\"],\n    },\n    module: {\n        rules: [\n            {\n                test: /.ts$/,\n                use: \"ts-loader\",\n                exclude: /node_modules/,\n            },\n        ],\n    },\n    optimization: {\n        minimize: false\n    },\n    mode: \"production\" // 生产模式，会对代码进行优化\n};\n```\n3. 运行指令编写 → package.json \n``` json\n\"scripts\": {\n    \"server\": \"ts-node-dev  ./app.ts --mode dev\",\n    \"tsc\": \"tsc\",\n    \"build\": \"webpack --mode production\",\n    \"rmjs\": \"ts-node-dev utilsPublic/rmjs.ts\",\n    \"perfectBuild\": \"tsc && webpack --mode production && ts-node-dev utilsPublic/rmjs.ts\",\n    \"fontUnicode\": \"ts-node-dev utilsPublic/unique.ts\"\n},\n```\ntsc : 将ts的代码编译为js\nbuild ：使用webpack将项目中的js进行打包\nrmjs : 将编译ts留下的js进行删除（自定义方法，不删除不行啊，在开发模式每次修改内容都不生效）\nperfectBuild ： 将node.ts打包一步到位 先转译ts→进行打包→删除js\n4. 补充一份删除js的代码  文件路径：utilsPublic/rmjs.ts 自行修改一下即可\n``` ts\n//node 删除项目中所有js文件\nimport fs from \"node:fs\"\nimport path from \"node:path\";\n\nconst files = fs.readdirSync(path.resolve(__dirname, \"../\"));\nconst exclude = [\n    \"node_modules\",\n    \".git\",\n    \".idea\",\n    \"dist\",\n    \"public\",\n    \"webpack.config.js\"\n]\n\n// 使用递归寻找出所有的js文件\nconst findJs = (files: string[], basePath: string): string[] => {\n    const jsFiles: string[] = [];\n    files.forEach((item) => {\n        const fullPath = path.join(basePath, item); // 获取文件的完整路径\n        if (exclude.includes(item)) return;\n        const stat = fs.statSync(fullPath);\n        if (stat.isDirectory()) {\n            const dirFiles = fs.readdirSync(fullPath);\n            jsFiles.push(...findJs(dirFiles, fullPath)); // 传入完整路径递归查找子目录\n        } else {\n            if (item.endsWith(\".js\")) {\n                jsFiles.push(fullPath);\n            }\n        }\n    });\n    return jsFiles;\n};\nconst jsFiles = findJs(files, path.resolve(__dirname, \"../\"));   \njsFiles.forEach((item) => {\n    fs.unlinkSync(item);\n})\n```\n\n5. 以上就是node+ts+webpack打包的全过程，缺点十分明显，没办法解决打包前后的路径问题，服务器跟本地的地址切换不方便，得手动去更换。还有就是没办法将静态资源public放入打包的dist文件夹中，得自己去复制一份。\n\n## 总结\n写这篇文章的时候很奇怪，不知道为什么快速的添加内容在markdown组件中就会将中文内容转为英文的。比如说快速的敲击几下空格，它会将你选中的内容，或者部分内容转换为英文的。不知道是不是markdown组件自带的。\n

Navicat Cloud could not connect and access your databases. By which it means, it could only store your connection settings, queries, model files, and virtual group; your database passwords and data (e.g. tables, views, etc) will not be stored to Navicat Cloud. Instead of wondering when your next vacation is, maybe you should set up a life you don’t need to escape from. With its well-designed Graphical User Interface(GUI), Navicat lets you quickly and easily create, organize, access and share information in a secure and easy way. To successfully establish a new connection to local/remote server - no matter via SSL, SSH or HTTP, set the database login information in the General tab. To get a secure connection, the first thing you need to do is to install OpenSSL Library and download Database Source. After logged in the Navicat Cloud feature, the Navigation pane will be divided into Navicat Cloud and My Connections sections. In other words, Navicat provides the ability for data in different databases and/or schemas to be kept up-to-date so that each repository contains the same information.
